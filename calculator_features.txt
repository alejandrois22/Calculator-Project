1. Scientific Functions: Add functions like trigonometric calculations (sin, cos, tan, and their inverses), logarithms, and factorials.

2. Memory Functions: Implement memory functions that are common on calculators, such as Memory Clear (MC), Memory Recall (MR), Memory Add (M+), and Memory Subtract (M-).

3. History Feature: Keep a history of calculations that users can scroll through and possibly reuse or edit.

4. Error Handling: Improve error feedback by providing more descriptive messages depending on the type of error (e.g., syntax error, math error).

5. Keyboard Input: Allow the user to use the keyboard for input, not just mouse clicks on buttons.

6. Copy/Paste Functionality: Enable users to copy and paste into and from the calculator display.

7. Unit Conversion: Implement a feature for converting between different units like length (meters, kilometers, miles), weight (kilograms, pounds), and volume (liters, gallons).

8. Currency Converter: Add functionality that can convert between different currencies (this might require an API to get current exchange rates).

9. Graphing Capabilities: For a more advanced project, add the ability to graph functions.

10. Programmable Functions: Allow users to define their own functions or calculations.

11. Complex Number Support: Add support for calculations with complex numbers.

12. Matrix Operations: Implement matrix operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, determinant, and inverse.

13. Themes and Customization: Let users choose different themes or customize the appearance of the calculator.

14. Sound Effects: Add optional sound effects for button clicks or certain actions.

15. Voice Recognition: Integrate voice commands for hands-free operation.

16. Offline Support: Ensure that if your calculator is web-based, it should work offline as well.

17. Responsive Design: If it's a web-based calculator, make sure it's responsive and works well on all devices.

18. Accessibility: Improve accessibility, e.g., support for screen readers, high contrast mode, etc.

19. Save Session: Ability to save the session and come back to it later with all the previous equations and results.

20. Tape Feature: Similar to history but shown as a "tape" that runs down the side of the calculator, showing all calculations as they are entered.
